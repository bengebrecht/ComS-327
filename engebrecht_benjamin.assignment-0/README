This assignmnent is all about listing the set of rational numbers. To this end, I have written two programs that use both iterative and recusive solutions to complete this problem.

ISSUES I RAN INTO:
	
	Allocating 100,000,000 integers isn't going to happen on the stack
	Heap is a lot better place for large arrays

TO MAKE:
	
	Run "make" in the root directory

OUTPUT:
	
	-program1 : Iterative solution
	-program2 : Recursive solution
