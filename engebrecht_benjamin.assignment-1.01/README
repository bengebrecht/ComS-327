This assignment requires the development of a console based dungeon generator. To accomplish this, I have written a short library of functions that keeps most of the code out of the main method for the sake of extensibility.


ISSUES I RAN INTO:
	
	-My corridor drawing algorithm isn't pretty

	-On the plus side, it uses substantially less processing power than Dijkstra's algorithm


THINGS I LEARNED:

	-Writing a line-drawing algorithm is one thing, writing a continuous line-drawing algorithm 
	 is another

	-The drawing_helper method was only 40 lines to begin with, corner cases expanded it to 
	 over 100	


TO MAKE:
	
	-Run "make all" in the root directory


OUTPUT:
	
	-main : The dungeon generator, can take input of a seed or just run to generate it randomly
